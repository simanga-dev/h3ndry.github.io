      <p class="text">
        In a nutshell, Hendry Khoza is a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering"
          >computer engineering</a
        >
        student at
        <a href="https://www.tut.ac.za/">Tshwane University of Technology</a>.
        One of the reason that made me choose this field of study is the
        opportunities that technology present to us to improve our daily lives.
        For instance, I recently switched to using
        <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> and I managed to automate some
        repetitive task on my work-flow and it made me productive and encouraged
        me to contribute to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-source</a>.

        It has been proven multiple times in the tech industry that schools can
        not teach you everything you need to know. Over these years I am at
        university I spent some time learning other technologies and
        frameworks/libraries that were not included in my syllabus. I’ve
        combined everything I learned from school and outside school to build
        the following projects:
