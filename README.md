## Who really is Hendry Khoza?

In a nutshell, Hendry Khoza is a [computer engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering) student at 
[Tshwane University of Technology](https://www.tut.ac.za/). One of the reason that made me choose 
this field of study is the opportunities that technology present to us to 
improve our daily lives. For instance, I recently switched to using [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)
and I managed to automate some repetitive task on my work-flow and it made me
productive and encouraged me to contribute to [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source).
